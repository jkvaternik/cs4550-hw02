9. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
I struggled a bit with setting up the calculator logic. I knew we were
allowed one global variable but wasn't sure types were allowed. I
ended up going with a object to control the state which worked, but I
spent a while trying other approaches because I wasn't sure if our
global variable could be an object... I also was a bit confused as to
whether or not I should use the eval() function that I found on the
w3schools site. I looked into the function more and saw that it was
discouraged by the MDN docs. Because of this, I also tried other
options but defaulted to eval in the end.
